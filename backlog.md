## Implementation Strategy

The backlog is organized into four phases with clear dependencies. Here's the recommended implementation approach:

1. **Start with Foundation:** Begin with type definitions and utility extraction, which have no dependencies but provide immediate benefits.

2. **State Management:** Focus on replacing global state with React Context as early as possible, as many other improvements depend on this.

3. **Component Structure:** Once state management is improved, break down large components into smaller, more focused ones.

4. **Performance and Error Handling:** After the foundation is solid, address performance bottlenecks and improve error handling.

5. **Modernization and UX:** Use modern Next.js patterns and improve accessibility and responsive design.

6. **Testing and Documentation:** Throughout the process, but especially after major refactoring, add tests and documentation.

This approach minimizes risk by tackling the most fundamental issues first, creating a solid foundation for further improvements. The implementation can be done incrementally, validating each step before moving to the next.
