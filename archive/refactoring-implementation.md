# Refactoring Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the extraction refactoring that was identified in the codebase.

## Implemented Refactorings

### 1. Context Creation Pattern

Created a generic context factory pattern to eliminate boilerplate in context creation:

- `/src/contexts/factory/createContext.ts` - Base factory for creating context providers
- `/src/contexts/factory/createReducerContext.ts` - Extended factory for reducer-based contexts
- `/src/contexts/factory/annotationFactory.ts` - Annotation-specific factory implementation
- `/src/contexts/AnnotationContext.refactored.tsx` - Refactored example using the factory

Benefits:
- Reduces repetitive boilerplate across context files
- Provides consistent error handling and naming conventions
- Makes context files more focused on business logic
- Improves type safety with TypeScript

### 2. Utility Extraction

#### Format Utilities
Extracted common formatting functions into a dedicated module:
- `/src/utils/formatUtils.ts` - Contains time, file size, duration, and timestamp formatting

#### Media Conversion Utilities
Extracted blob/base64 conversion utilities:
- `/src/utils/mediaConversionUtils.ts` - Handles media conversion between formats

#### API Utilities
Created reusable error handling and response patterns:
- `/src/utils/apiUtils.ts` - Contains standardized API response handling

## Upgrade Path

### Immediate Changes

These files can now be used as replacements for their duplicated counterparts:

1. Replace direct format functions with imports from `formatUtils` in:
   - `VideoContext.tsx` 
   - `VideoPlayer.tsx`

2. Replace base64/blob conversions with imports from `mediaConversionUtils` in:
   - `VideoPlayerWrapper.tsx`

3. Use `AnnotationContext.refactored.tsx` as a guide to refactor other contexts

### Further Refactoring

1. Complete context pattern migration:
   - Refactor `VideoContext.tsx`, `TimelineContext.tsx`, `AuthContext.tsx`, etc. using the same pattern
   - Update imports in components to use the new context hooks

2. API route refactoring:
   - Integrate `apiUtils` pattern into API routes
   - Standardize error handling across API endpoints

3. Create testing strategy:
   - Add comprehensive tests for utility functions
   - Test context factories with different configurations

## Benefits of These Changes

- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminates repeated patterns and utility functions
- **Improved Maintainability**: Centralizes common logic for easier updates
- **Better Error Handling**: Standardizes error messages and handling patterns
- **Enhanced Testability**: Makes isolated testing of utilities possible
- **Type Safety**: Provides better TypeScript inference through generics
