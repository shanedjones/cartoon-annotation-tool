# Recent Changes

## Directory Structure Cleanup

1. **Removed Duplicate Directories**
   - Removed empty `/src/app` and `/src/api` directories
   - These were duplicates of the main `/app` directory
   - All routes are now properly located in the `/app` directory

2. **Fixed Directory Structure**
   - Removed redundant `src\` directory (with backslash)
   - Corrected TypeScript error in CosmosDB utility

3. **Added Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with modern directory structure
   - Added PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md to document the directory organization
   - Added HTTP_CACHING.md to document the caching implementation

## HTTP Caching Implementation

1. **Replaced Custom Video Cache**
   - Removed custom IndexedDB-based caching in `src/utils/videoCache.ts`
   - Now rely on browser's built-in HTTP caching

2. **Updated Components**
   - Simplified `VideoContext.tsx` to remove caching-related code
   - Updated `VideoPlayer.tsx` to use standard video loading
   - Removed cache-related UI elements and state

3. **Added Cache Headers**
   - Added `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` to GET API responses
   - Added `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` to mutation responses
   - Maintained proper cache headers for audio content

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Code**
   - Removed complex IndexedDB implementation
   - Eliminated redundant directories
   - Improved code organization

2. **Better Performance**
   - Leverages browser's built-in cache
   - Improved cache efficiency with proper HTTP headers
   - Reduced memory usage by not storing videos in IndexedDB

3. **Modern Structure**
   - Now follows Next.js App Router best practices
   - Clear separation between UI components and API routes
   - Improved directory organization
