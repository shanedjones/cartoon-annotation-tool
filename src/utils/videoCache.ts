// This file previously contained the custom video caching implementation
// using IndexedDB. This functionality has been removed in favor of
// using standard HTTP caching. The browser's built-in cache will now
// automatically handle video caching based on Cache-Control headers
// provided by the server.

// This file is kept as a placeholder for any future caching needs,
// but currently has no active functionality.
