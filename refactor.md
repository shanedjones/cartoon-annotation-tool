   - Isolated enhancement with immediate error handling benefits

4. **Inadequate Interface Definitions** (8/10)
   - Fix: Strengthen TypeScript interfaces by making optional properties required where appropriate
   - Code-level changes with no runtime impacts

5. **Overusing 'any' Type** (9/10)
   - Fix: Replace 'any' with proper types, especially in component refs
   - Improves type safety without changing runtime behavior

6. **Type Assertions Instead of Type Guards** (7/10)
   - Fix: Convert type assertions to proper type guards
   - Isolated TypeScript improvements with minimal risk

7. **Done: Missing Component Memoization** (8/10)
   - Fix: Added React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback in performance-critical areas
   - Incremental performance improvements with low implementation risk

8. **Ignoring Accessibility** (9/10)
   - Fix: Add ARIA attributes and improve keyboard navigation
   - Can be done incrementally without breaking changes

## Medium Difficulty Fixes

9. **Improper useEffect Dependencies** (9/10)
   - Fix: Add missing dependencies to useEffect hooks and refactor as needed
   - Requires careful testing as it may change component behavior

10. **Inadequate Error Handling and Logging** (8/10)
    - Fix: Implement consistent error handling across the application
    - Requires coordination across components but can be done incrementally

11. **Overusing useState** (8/10)
    - Fix: Consolidate related state variables using useReducer
    - Moderate refactoring with medium risk of regressions

12. **Direct DOM Manipulation** (6/10)
    - Fix: Replace direct DOM access with React refs and controlled components
    - Requires careful testing of Canvas components

13. **Inadequate Input Validation** (9/10)
    - Fix: Add comprehensive client and server validation
    - Moderate complexity touching multiple components

14. **Prop Drilling** (9/10)
    - Fix: Introduce Context API or state management for deeply nested props
    - Medium complexity refactoring affecting component relationships

15. **Insecure File Uploads** (6/10)
    - Fix: Add proper file type validation and size limits
    - Requires changes to both frontend and backend code

16. **JWT Implementation Flaws** (6/10)
    - Fix: Enhance NextAuth configuration with proper security settings
    - Moderate risk as it affects authentication system

17. **Exposed Environment Variables** (7/10)
    - Fix: Properly prefix client-side variables and secure server variables
    - Medium complexity affecting build configuration

## Major Refactoring (Complex Fixes)

18. **Large Component Files** (8/10)
    - Fix: Break down large components into smaller, focused components
    - High complexity due to interdependencies and state management

19. **Poor Component Composition** (8/10)
    - Fix: Restructure component hierarchy with proper separation of concerns
    - Complex refactoring affecting multiple parts of the application

20. **Client-Side Data Exposure** (8/10)
    - Fix: Move sensitive data handling to server components/API routes
    - Significant architectural changes required

21. **Improper Data Fetching Strategies** (8/10)
    - Fix: Implement proper Next.js data fetching methods (getServerSideProps, getStaticProps)
    - Major refactoring of data flow architecture

22. **Ignoring App Directory Structure Benefits** (7/10)
    - Fix: Reorganize application to leverage Next.js app directory features
    - Extensive restructuring of the application

23. **Untyped State Management** (8/10)
    - Fix: Implement strongly typed state management throughout the application
    - Comprehensive refactoring with high testing requirements

24. **Not Using Incremental Static Regeneration** (7/10)
    - Fix: Implement ISR for appropriate routes and data
    - Requires significant architecture changes

25. **Misusing Server and Client Components** (8/10)
    - Fix: Properly separate server and client components
    - Major refactoring of component architecture

26. **Insecure API Endpoints** (7/10)
    - Fix: Implement proper rate limiting, auth checks, and validation
    - Complex changes to backend infrastructure

27. **Poor State Management Architecture** (8/10)
    - Fix: Consolidate multiple contexts and implement proper state management
    - Extensive refactoring affecting the entire application

28. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities** (8/10)
    - Fix: Comprehensive security review and input sanitization
    - Complex changes across the entire application

29. **Inadequate Error Handling for Security Events** (8/10)
    - Fix: Implement robust security-focused error handling and logging
    - Complex integration with security monitoring systems

This prioritized list allows you to start with the easiest, lowest-risk fixes that provide immediate benefits, then gradually work toward the more complex refactoring efforts as resources and time permit.
